## ℹ️ Introduction

The operator **Dokkaebi** of the Competitive FPS **Rainbow Six Siege (R6)**, is a true technological genius, she has the special ability **Logic Bomb**. This ability allows Dokkaebi to hack into enemies' electronic devices, causing their phones to ring persistently. This ringing forces opposing operators to reveal their location by forcing them to answer their devices to stop the noise. Dokkaebi can also recover his victims' phones in order to hack enemy cameras on the defenders' side.
